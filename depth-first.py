input_tree = '??? How do you write a tree??? Time to consult the internet!'

# first you have to find the node
# then you have to choose a direction, say, the most left branch
# then you repeat that procedure until you get to a leaf
# if you get to a leaf, you have to move back up to its parent
# then you have to test the second-most-left branch that hasn't been tested
# this is a recursion problem

# a breadth-first search will involve making a queue and testing from there?
# but this is all quite nontrivial.
